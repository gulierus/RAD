    "## Questions for a linear regression analysis of house rent\n",
    "\n",
    "When building a linear regression model for rent, it is useful to think\n",
    "in terms of a workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Understand the data**\n",
    "   - What is the response variable (e.g. `Rent`)?  \n",
    "     What are the main predictor types (numeric, categorical, locations,\n",
    "     amenities)?\n",
    "   - Are there obvious data quality issues (missing values, impossible\n",
    "     values, outliers)?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Preprocessing and feature engineering**\n",
    "   - How should categorical variables (e.g. city, furnishing status,\n",
    "     point of contact) be encoded for a linear model (one?hot encoding,\n",
    "     target encoding, etc.)?\n",
    "   - Which numeric variables might benefit from scaling (standardization\n",
    "     or robust scaling), and why can this matter for regularized\n",
    "     regression?\n",
    "   - Are there interactions that are conceptually meaningful\n",
    "     (e.g. `BHK , Size`, `City , DistanceFromMainArea`)?\n",
    "   - Can we create more interpretable features (e.g. rent per square\n",
    "     foot, distance to city centre bins)?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Transformations of response and regressors**\n",
    "   - Is the distribution of `Rent` highly skewed or heavy tailed? Would a\n",
    "     log transformation (modeling $\\log(\\text{Rent})$) stabilize\n",
    "     variance and make residuals closer to normal?\n",
    "   - Do some predictors show non linear relationships with rent? Would\n",
    "     polynomial terms, splines, or monotone transforms (log, square\n",
    "     root) be appropriate?\n",
    "   - Are there predictors that should be centered or standardized before\n",
    "     creating interaction or polynomial terms?\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Model specification and selection**\n",
    "   - Start with a simple baseline: which variables should be included in\n",
    "     a first OLS model, and how do residual plots look?\n",
    "   - How to compare alternative specifications\n",
    "     (different sets of features, transformed vs untransformed variables)\n",
    "     using cross validation or a validation set?\n",
    "   - When is it useful to move from plain OLS to regularized models such\n",
    "     as ridge or lasso (e.g. many correlated predictors, high variance)?\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Model evaluation and diagnostics**\n",
    "   - How to check linear model assumptions: residual vs fitted plots,\n",
    "     QQ plots, heteroscedasticity, influential observations?\n",
    "   - Which error metrics are most relevant here\n",
    "     (RMSE, MAE, MAPE)?  How do training and test errors compare\n",
    "     (overfitting vs underfitting)?\n",
    "   - Are there systematic groups of houses (by city, BHK, furnishing)\n",
    "     for which the model performs much worse, suggesting missing\n",
    "     structure or interactions?\n"

    "  - Do we need to cap or Winsorize extreme values of `Rent` or `Size`\n",
    "    before fitting a linear model?\n",
